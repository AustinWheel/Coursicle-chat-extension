# Coursicle-chat-extension
## What is it?
This is an extension that can be added to your chrome browser. When you navigate to any of Coursicle's university calendars you will see a chat window popup on the side of the page. Here you can see chats for classes you've added to your schedule and then you can message and interact with others taking your same classes. You can ask other students for insights, advice, or even help studying for the class!

p.s. If you like this extension checkout my other extension, Coursicle Dark Mode, currently available for download at https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/coursicle-dark-mode/mpdffanappnhfhnefgfdlldalimiehod

## How does it work
When you add your classes you can refresh the page to see the classes you've added. That's it! Just start messaging afterwards!
